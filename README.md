Web Developer
-------------

From the moment I created my first webpage at the age of 12, I knew I had a passion for programming. Since then, I've
been constantly exploring and learning new technologies, driven by the excitement of solving problems and building
useful solutions. Currently, I’m diving deep into Symfony and Next.js with TypeScript, expanding my skills to become a
more versatile developer. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a desire to continuously improve. In my spare
time, you’ll often find me riding my bike or walking through the forest, where I draw inspiration from nature. I also
enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and having insightful discussions about all things programming. Looking ahead,
I'm not only working on advancing my technical skills but also planning a personal project close to my heart: building a
cozy house for my mother near the forest. Thanks for stopping by! Let's connect and collaborate. 🚀
